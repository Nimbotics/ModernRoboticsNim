# Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control
## Nim Library

This Library is based off of the the book, [Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics) (Kevin Lynch and Frank Park, Cambridge University Press 2017).
This repository is a translation of the original library that went with the book available at 
https://github.com/NxRLab/ModernRobotics and you can find more information on their github repo
however there are a few additions of my own that I have added to this library. According to the 
library's original authors the functions within are not optimized however in the future there 
maybe work on improving for this library.Everything contained within should be complete with 
mostly full test suite to go along with every function within. Some form of BLAS and LAPACK may 
be needed in order for the Linear Algebra Library to work if you are on windows libopenblas can be
utilized for both of those needs. Pull Requests and opening issues are welcome.
